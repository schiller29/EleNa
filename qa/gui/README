In general, the tests pertain mainly to the front-end since the algortihm was
not plugged into the front-end until closer to the deadline due to the complexity
of developing the project and integrating the systems.

Anyways, running the tests are fairly simple. Chromedriver should be able to run
on Unix based systems or Windows. It is used to integrate between selenium and
newer browsers. If selenium is not installed yet, got to http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/
and install the appropriate dependencies. Once installed, the selenium import statements should be
working. Running the tests are simple:

python test_ui_validation.py



The output should look something like this: 

mschiller:gui mschiller$ python test_ui_validation.py
.....................

Ran 21 tests in 106.899s

OK


Those should cover the known issues I have encountered when setting up the testing framework.

Also, of course the web-app needs to be running on localhost port 4200.
